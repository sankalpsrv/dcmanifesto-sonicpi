# dcmanifesto-sonicpi
This repo contains the livecode that I added to a TTS recording of Eben Moglen's essay titled "The dotCommunist Manifesto" on youtube (https://youtu.be/Cfrs48V1na4)

- There are four files containing the code for the four main threads that play alongisde the TTS recording on Youtuibe. 

- The code can be run in a Sonic-Pi interface (I used version 3.3.1 on Windows to compose this livecode).
